# Urban-Heat-Island-Dynamics-GEE

This repository contains the code and samples used for a study investigating the spatio-temporal land use characteristics of Nairobi, Kenya, and their influence on Urban Heat Island (UHI) dynamics. The research aimed at identifying the challenges of urbanization, particularly the emergence of UHIs. UHI play a sugnificant role in ecological functions, energy demand, and the health of urban dwellers. The study focuses on Nairobi, a rapidly growing city in Kenya. 
The data preparation and analysis were done on Google Earth Engine (GEE). Post processing for better cartographical visualization was done  on ArcGIS pro.
